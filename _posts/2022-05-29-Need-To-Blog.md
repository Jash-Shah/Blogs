# Intro
I've always felt like the need to blog, but never got around to it. Maybe I thought I didnt have the right material *juuust yet*. I was waiting for something "*cool* or *exciting*" to happen, but as I grew out of my teens, I've come to realize that <mark>Life just by it's nature is cool!</mark>. So, I've decided to start blogging my experiences, however "*boring*" or `insignificant in the grand scheme of things` they might seem, because this is LIFE, in all it's unescapable but beautiful glory! and <br><br>
*`Life is a just series of boring events leading up to something cool and memorable =)`*
