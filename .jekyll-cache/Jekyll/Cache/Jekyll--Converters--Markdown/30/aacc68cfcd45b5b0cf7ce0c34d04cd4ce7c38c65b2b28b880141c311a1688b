I"‡<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve always felt like the need to blog, but never got around to it. Maybe I thought I just didnt have the right material juuust yet. I was waiting for something <em>cool</em> or <em>exciting</em> to happen, but as I grew out of my teens, Iâ€™ve come to realize that <mark>Life is cool by itself!</mark>. So, Iâ€™ve decided to start blogging my expereinces, however <em>boring</em> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insignificant in the grand scheme of things</code> they might seem, because this is LIFE, and Life is a series of boring events leading up to something cool and memorable :joy:</p>
