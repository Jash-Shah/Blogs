<p>The official <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/how-gsoc-works">GSoC docs</a> describes the Community Bonding Period as <em>“The first phase in which you get to know your community and get familiar with their code base and work style.”</em> So following this definition, my main goal in these few weeks(20th May - 13th June) was to get to learn the inner workings of Gnuastro and trying to understand the communication within Gnuastro, by becoming an active part of the community.</p>
