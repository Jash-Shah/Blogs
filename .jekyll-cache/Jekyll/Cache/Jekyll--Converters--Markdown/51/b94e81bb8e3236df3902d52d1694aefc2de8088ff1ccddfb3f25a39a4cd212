<p>As discussed in my last GSoC blog, I was mainly using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">distutils</code> along with itâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">distutils.setup</code> script to take care of all the building and linking required for building the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.so</code> (shared object) file required by the  Python Interpreter. However, after one of my co-mentors brought up a good point that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setuptools</code> is the packaging tool that is recommended by <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/">PyPA</a> and also using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wheels</code> to package the modules instead of the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup.py build</code> command.</p>
