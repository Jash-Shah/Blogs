I"‹<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ve always felt like the need to blog, but never got around to it. Maybe I thought I didnt have the right material <em>juuust yet</em>. I was waiting for something â€œ<em>cool</em> or <em>exciting</em>â€ to happen, but as I grew out of my teens, Iâ€™ve come to realize that <mark>Life just by it's nature is cool!</mark>. So, Iâ€™ve decided to start blogging my experiences, however â€œ<em>boring</em>â€ or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insignificant in the grand scheme of things</code> they might seem, because this is LIFE, in all itâ€™s unescapable but beautiful glory! and <br /><br />
<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Life is a just series of boring events leading up to something cool and memorable =)</code></em></p>
