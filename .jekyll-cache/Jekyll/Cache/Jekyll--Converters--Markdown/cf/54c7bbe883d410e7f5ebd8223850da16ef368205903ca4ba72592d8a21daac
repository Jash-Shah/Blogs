<p>So, now that I got to know the Gnuastro community a bit and had discussed the plan of attack with my mentor it was time to start with the actual coding.</p>

<h3 id="week-1">Week 1</h3>
<p>As planned, I started with the building the extension module for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gnuastro/manual/html_node/CosmicCalculator.html">Cosmic Calculator</a>(cosmiccal) library. A simple Python extension Module should be structed as:</p>

<p><img src="/Blogs/img/posts/gsoc-coding-begins/code-block-1.png" alt="Code-Block1" /></p>

<p>The reason for starting with the cosmiccal library was that it had only 6 functions and all of them only dealt with <em>doubles,ints and floats</em>. Hence, there wasnâ€™t a need for a NumPy Converter just yet.
Following the structure above, it was quite straightforward to build wrappers for these functions. The next step involved writing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup.py</code> script for building and installing these modules. For this, as recommended on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html#building">Python Extension docs</a> I used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html"><u>distutils</u></a> which provides two important functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.core.Extension"><u>distutils.core.Extension</u></a> which is used to describe a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C/C++</code> extension.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.core.setup"><u>distutils.core.setup</u></a> the frontman in actually building and compiling the modules.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Blogs/img/posts/gsoc-coding-begins/code-block-2.png" alt="Code-Block2" /></p>

<p>After this, the commands to build and install these modules were simply:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py <span class="nb">install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="week-2">Week 2</h3>
<p>I got the progress verified by my mentor in our next meet, and we agreed that the next step should be writing the NumPy converter so that this can be <em>extended</em> to the other library modules as well.</p>

<p>Week 2 was a bit sparse in work as I was out of town for a few days, hence it was tough to try to put much code down. Although, I spent most of my time reading up on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NumPy C-API</code> and how it interacted with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Python C-API</code>.</p>

<p>What I learnt was that the main container object for a NumPy array was the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArrayObject"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyArrayObject</code></a> and its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyTypeObject</code> was the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/c-api/types-and-structures.html#c.PyArray_Type"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyArray_Type</code></a>. Hence, for any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyObject</code> to be considered a NumPy Array, it needed to comply with these two properties.</p>

<p>There were <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/c-api/array.html#creating-arrays">functions</a> provided by the API itself, which could convert any generic array type data container into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyArray_Type</code> or one of itâ€™s subtypes. These would be my go-to for building the converter!</p>
