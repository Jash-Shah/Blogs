<p>So, now that I got to know the Gnuastro community a bit and had discussed the plan of attack with my mentor it was time to start with the actual coding.</p>

<h3 id="week-1">Week 1</h3>
<p>As planned, I started with the building the extension module for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gnuastro/manual/html_node/CosmicCalculator.html">Cosmic Calculator</a>(cosmiccal) library. A simple Python extension Module should be structed as:</p>

<p>The reason for starting with the cosmiccal library was that it had only 6 functions and all of them only dealt with <em>doubles,ints and floats</em>. Hence, there wasnâ€™t a need for a NumPy Converter just yet.
Following the structure above, it was quite straightforward to build wrappers for these functions.</p>
