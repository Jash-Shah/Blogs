<p>I’ve always felt like the need to blog, but never got around to it. Maybe I thought I didnt have the right material <em>juuust yet</em>. I was waiting for something “<em>cool</em> or <em>exciting</em>” to happen, but as I grew out of my teens, I’ve come to realize that <mark>Life just by it's nature is cool!</mark>. So, I’ve decided to start blogging my experiences, however “<em>boring</em>” or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insignificant in the grand scheme of things</code> they might seem, because this is LIFE, in all it’s unescapable but beautiful glory! and <br /><br />
<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Life is a just series of boring events leading up to something cool and memorable =)</code></em></p>
